CalcStudio
Interactive calculus visualizer for students and educators

**CalcStudio** is an interactive calculus learning tool with visualizations of derivatives, integrals, and other calculus concepts (soon to have AI/ML and multivariable concepts). Built from scratch with Python, PyQt5, Matplotlib, and Numpy to support conceptual understanding through dynamic graphs and intuitive PyQt5 UI. Used for tutoring and self-study across AP and early college curriculum.

Built for individuals who are learning advanced math concepts, CalcStudio breaks down these topics using visuals and interactive sliders and buttons that the user can control.

Main Features:
  - Derivatives: Tangent Line at a Point > Given a function and a specific point, this feature visualizes what the tangent line of the function at that point would look like.
  - Integrals: Area Under a Curve > Given a function and two points, this feature visualizes the area under a curve between two points.
  - Integrals: Riemann Sums > Given a function, number of rectangles, and two points, this feature approximates the are under a curve using Riemann sums and evaluates percent error.

*More advanced concepts will be built in the future*

Who is this Application For?
- Students Studying AP Calculus AB/BC or Equivalent
- University Learners in Early STEM Math Courses
- Educators Seeking Visual Teaching Tools
- Anybody Curious about how Math works

Tech Stack
- Python 3
